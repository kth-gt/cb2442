# Lecture Notes acompaning the Alignment block

Here we store material relating to Alignments.

First we have the preparatory material, that should be read befor each lecture:

* [Introduction to Sequence Alignments](intro.md)
* [Algorithms for Pairwise Alignments](algorithm.md)
* [Protein Sequence Alignments](protein.md)
* [Multiple Sequence Alignments](msa.md)
* [Sequence Retrieval](retrieve.md)

And the lecture slides:

* [Algorithms for Pairwise Alignments](slides/Algorithms_for_sequence_alignments.pdf)
* [Protein Sequence Alignments](slides/Aligning_protein_sequences.pdf)
* [Multiple Sequence Alignments](slides/Multiple_Sequence_Alignments.pdf)
* [Sequence Retrieval](slides/Sequence_Retrieval.pdf)

The programming naive alignment algorithm that was semonstrated under the intodctorly lecture can be found [here](code/naive.py)

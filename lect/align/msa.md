# Multiple Sequence Alignments

Before the lecture:

* Read the section on Multiple Sequence Alignments (p67-69) in Chapter 4 in [St Clair & Visick](https://karbokhandeln.se/kemi/exploring-bioinformatics-a-project-based/)
* Watch the online lecture on [multiple sequence alignments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzRT9udYvY8), [slides](slides/Multiple_Sequence_Alignments.pdf)
* Pose or answer a question in the appropriate canvas thread. I will edit the questions and post them on this [site](../qa/msa.md).

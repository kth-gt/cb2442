# Sequence Retrieval

Before the lecture:

* Read the the rest of Chapter 4 in [St Clair & Visick](https://karbokhandeln.se/kemi/exploring-bioinformatics-a-project-based/)
* Watch the online lecture on [Sequence Retrieval](https://youtu.be/z1lyJKHeeBU), [slides](slides/Sequence_Retrieval.pdf)
* Try to BLAST a squence yourself, by entering a sequence e.g. "APEPTIDETHATILIKE" or your name into [NCBI's BLAST webserver](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastp&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch)
* Pose or answer at least one question in the appropriate canvas thread. I will edit the questions and post them on this [site](../qa/retrieve.md).

# Sequence Retrieval

Before the lecture:

* Read Chapter 15 and 16 of [BIBook](https://www.kaell.se/bibook/retrieval/blast.html)
* Optionally: Watch the online lecture on [Sequence Retrieval](https://youtu.be/z1lyJKHeeBU), [slides](slides/Sequence_Retrieval.pdf)
* Try to BLAST a squence yourself, by entering a sequence e.g. "APEPTIDETHATILIKE" or your name into [NCBI's BLAST webserver](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastp&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch).
* Pose or answer at least one question in the appropriate Canvas thread. Alternatively, if you find any error in the book chapter report it by clicking on the "suggest an edit" or "open an issue" buttons on top of the book's top bar.

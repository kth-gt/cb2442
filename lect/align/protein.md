# Protein Sequence Alignments

Before the lecture:

* Read Chapter 5 in [St Clair & Visick](https://karbokhandeln.se/kemi/exploring-bioinformatics-a-project-based/)
* Watch the online lecture on [protein sequence alignments](https://youtu.be/bIelmjRhWsw), [slides](slides/Aligning_protein_sequences.pdf).
* Read [Eddy](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0804-1035)
* Pose or answer a question in the appropriate canvas thread. I will edit the questions and post them on this [site](../qa/protein.md).

# Algorithms for pairwise Alignments

Before the lecture:

* Read (the rest of) Chapter 3 in [St Clair & Visick](https://karbokhandeln.se/kemi/exploring-bioinformatics-a-project-based/)
* Watch the online lecture on [alignment algorithms](https://youtu.be/ACgY8zI0utk). You can find a copy of the slides [here](slides/Algorithms_for_sequence_alignments.pdf)
* Pose or answer at least one question in the appropriate canvas thread. I will edit the questions and post them on this [site](../qa/algorithm.md).

## Code

There is some code relating to this lecture that can be found, and executed, in [this notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kth-gt/cb2442/main?labpath=lect%2Falign%2Fcode%2Fpairwise.ipynb).

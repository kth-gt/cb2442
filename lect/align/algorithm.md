# Algorithms for pairwise Alignments

Before the lecture:

* Read Chapter 3-8 of [BIBook](https://www.kaell.se/bibook/pairwise/needleman.html)
* Optionally: Watch the online lecture on [alignment algorithms](https://youtu.be/ACgY8zI0utk). You can find a copy of the slides [here](slides/Algorithms_for_sequence_alignments.pdf)
* Pose or answer at least one question in the appropriate Canvas thread. Alternatively, if you find any error in the book chapter report it by clicking on the "suggest an edit" or "open an issue" buttons on top of the book's top bar.

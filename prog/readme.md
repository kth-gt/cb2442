## Practical information regarding the programming labs

### Groups

You are expected to work in pairs.

### Peer discussion

When your team is finished with the programming task (when your script seems to work as it should) you should find another team that is also ready and show and explain your respective code to each other. The idea here is that you should see that programming tasks can be solved in different ways, and get new ideas for how to solve programming problems.

### Demonstrating your code to a teaching assistant 

When both groups have demonstrated their code (and potential remaining bugs have been fixed), you should contact a teaching assistant (TA) and go through your teamâ€™s code with the TA. If the TA finds your code working as it should, you will get a Pass on the exercise. Due to the set-up of these exercises, it is important that you participate on-site. If you for some reason cannot participate on-site, contact the course responsible. In this case, you will be asked to conduct the lab remotely and will be asked to hand in a lab report.
